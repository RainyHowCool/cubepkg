1. About cubepkg

    `cubepkg` is a cross-platform package manager, and all packages is running in cubepkg-vm.

2. What differences

    Maybe you will ask: "Java is cross-platform too, why I use cubepkg to publish my `cubepkg-vm-application` instead of publish **.jar** file?" yeah. Nowadays the developers of cubepkg hasn't developed some differences better than *Java* or *.NET*, actually we hasn't developed any futures. but in future, we will finish and include the project `Catalyst`. *Project Catalyst* can convert your binary application into `cubepkg-vm-application`, and turn back lmao.So it is able to provide native performance (maybe).

3. Our plans

    You know. This project doesn't even belong to the alpha stage! But we made the future plan.

        1. Write the cubepkg-vmassembler    🤖 In progress

        2. Write the cubepkg-vm runner      🤖 In progress

        3. ***Project Catalyst***           ❎ Too hard and not started

        4. Package format                   ❌ Not started

        5. Package sharing network          💰 Hasn't money for server lol
